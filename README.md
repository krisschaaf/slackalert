## Sad News

This Project was only left in fragments due the cyberattack on the haw hamburg.

Files that could not be saved:

    src/main/java/se2_webapp/backend/persistance/repository/
        GitlabSetupRepository.java

    mvnw.cmd

As you can see, this project was stored in Gitlab during the attack.
